In this project, we have made a Reinforcement Learning Agent utilizing the Deep Q-learning algorithm to maximize the returns of a given portfolio. 
We have also compared the profits generated by the RL agent with those of an LSTM model, which was outperformed by the RL agent.

This Project was done by Jatin, Hrishikesh, and Sangeetha during the latest Summers(i.e. Summers'24)
